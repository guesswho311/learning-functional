### Chapter 1
- benefits of fp
- a pure function is simply a function that performs its task without any side effects.
- referential transparency: if we swapped an expression for its value it would not change the meaning of the program
- Writing referentially transparent functions enables us to use the substitution model, which I think is a natural way to break down how a program will evaluate

### Chapter 2
- Basic introduction to scala syntax, creating a program, modules, namespacing, etc
- Jumps straight into higher-order functions
- Polymorphic functions: functions that operate on any type provided
- Anonyomous functions
- adhoc polymorphism
- currying, uncurrying, function composition

I thought chapter 1 started off pretty well. I'm not so sure about chapter 2 though. Considering this book is labeled as a tool for scala beginners and veterans, I think diving straight into some of these concepts would be a little bit intense for a beginner.
