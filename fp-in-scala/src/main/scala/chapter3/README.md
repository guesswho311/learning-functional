### Chapter 3
- Create a list implementation
- teaches pattern matching as well as guards
- Dives straight into recursion
- mapping across lists
- Algebraic Data types - a data type defined by its constructors, each constructor may contain as many arguments as it wants
- Trees in Scala

Great chapter, though I think some of the exercises would be almost impossible for a beginner.
